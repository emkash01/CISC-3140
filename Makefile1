#I did not understand the directions for this part, but I tried my best to try to make it work given my interpretation. Other than syntax
# one major difference regarding makefiles and shell scripts is how Makefiles use a completely different structure. In particular I am 
# referring to the :'s being used throughout initial. I watched a few youtube videos to assist me with this and the bash script section,
# but this was what I came up with in the end.
